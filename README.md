# VBA-challenge

This is a class assignment to summarize stock data for each of three years of data using VBA in excel.  Due to the size of the data set, the main excel data
file is not included. In its place are screen shots showing the result of running the VBA script on the excel data sheets.  The script should work in any excel file
that is set up in the same manner as the original.  The code was figured out with the solved class assignments of Stu_CreditCardChecker and Stu_Census as a model.
